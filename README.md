This program starts the services for the Oracle Server 23ai (https://www.oracle.com/database/free/get-started/#windows)

Then it sits in the system tray as an icon and waits for a right click action on its icon for managing DBMS tools like opening the client SQL Developer for interacing with the server, opening the file path to the Oracle server and database files, or close the server related services (they might start again at system startup if they're not set to manual).

How to start :

Dearchive the archive (.zip), double click on the application. If nothing new appears in system tray (also click the up-pointing arrow for the hidden tray icons to check), it means that Windows blocked the app (it happens when using native File Explorer dearchiving tool). To fix this right click on the .exe file -> Properties -> Unblock -> OK
